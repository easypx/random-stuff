[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Moments of eternity
Strangers stealing someone else′s dream
I've seen it all

Haunting for a mystery
Longing for your life in times like these
I′ve seen it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember the time
Once in your life, oh baby
Get you here in my head
Here in my head, oh maybe

[Chorus]
I've seen it all, seen it all
I've seen it all, seen it all

// Standard Extend //

[Verse 2]
Waiting on the battlefields
Time is running slow until it ends
I′ve seen it all

Haunting for a mystery
Longing for your life in times like these
I′ve seen it all

// Standard Extend //

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember the time
Once in your life, oh baby
Get you here in my head
Here in my head, oh maybe

[Chorus]
I've seen it all, seen it all
I′ve seen it all, seen it all
Like I've never seen before

// Standard Extend //

[Outro]
(Catching of the smile instead of all)
(Asking you to never let me go)
(It will never be the same forever)
(I′ve seen it all)

[End]
